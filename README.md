## Casual Remarks

**This is a library of some open-source programing of mine.** 

**Programming helps me a lot in my study and research experience. The more techniques and knowledges I learn, the more powerful I am (to solve problems). However, I have never received professional training for Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, and there is a long way to become a truly strong in the discipline. I hope this 'Cabinet' could organize and record the growth experience of my skills.** 

*PS: if you are interested in one or some of these program, there are some notes in corresponding directory; you could create an issues or contact me directly (e-mail: oldkurocat@outlook.com)*
