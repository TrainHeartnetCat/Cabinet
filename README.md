## Casual Remarks

**This is a library of some open-source programing of mine.** 

**Programming helps me a lot in my study and research experience. The more techniques and knowledges I learn, the more powerful I am (to solve problems). However, I have never received professional training for Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, and there is a long way to become a truly strong in the discipline. I hope this 'Cabinet' could organize and record the growth experience of my skills.** 

*PS: if you are interested in one or some of these program, there are some notes in corresponding directory. Please notice that these program may not always work well on your system due to the change of running environment; you could create an issues or contact me directly for troubles you meet.
