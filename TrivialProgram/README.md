**Here are some tool programs. They are preserved because they are not in common use, yet are useful.** 

**It was a new world, when it came to me that I could use scripting language to deal with images and powerpoints, or download attachments in e-mails in batch process fast and conveniently. Normally, one would prefer to use well-designed softs (especially, the UI) such as photoshop, powerpoint, originlab and etc. However, they are not always designed with batch process functions; scripting languages could help this. **

**I am going to  keep and share more ideas!**
