Programs which accept input from .sdf file of molecules (or SMILES/SMARTS) are very convenient to demonstrate the structures of molecules. And there are a lot of ready-made examples on the internet. However, most cases can only show the structure of molecule by stick, sphere and cartoon styles instead of ball and stick styles. 

With some modification, this program is allowed to show the ball and stick style (including other styles) of molecules based on the input(sdf files or SMILES).

*TODO*
Probably due to the update of browsers like edge, chrome, this program cannot show 3D graph properly in the jupyter book.
